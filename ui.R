<h3>Creating a Shiny App</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a nice looking shiny app</p>
<h3>Find a data set you are interested in</h3>
<p>For this project I'm going to let you choose your own data set. This should be a data set that has at least two categorical and at least two quantitive variables. See the previous project for a list of places with datasets. Alternatively, you could pull data from the web within your app (for instance baseball data (<a href=https://pitchrx.cpsievert.me/>link</a>) or twitter data (<a href=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/intro.html>link</a>)). Choose something you are interested in! We are going to create a shiny app (see specifications below) and later we will add some predictive modeling to the app.</p>
<h3>App Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Your app should have multiple pages to it. This should include an information page, two pages - each with at least one graph, and a page that allows the user to scroll through the data (or subset of data of interest). I don't care if you use the built in tabs for shiny or a package like shinydashboard, use the method you prefer.</li>
    <li> You should have at least two different dynamic UI elements.</li>
    <li> You should have a button that allows the user to save a plot they are viewing to a file.</li>
    <li> You should have an option to allow the user to save the data currently being used for a plot (or when they are looking at the data table) to a .csv (or other) file.</li>
    <li> You should utilize the ability to click on a plot or select a region in some way.</li>
    <li> You should include some type of math type (maybe an equation or just a special symbol you need to use mathJax for).</li>
<li>You should include a link to something and some other formatted text.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style='color:#009933'>Requirements from Project 3</h2>
     <h3>Continuing Your App</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to add some modeling and expoloratory elements to your app.</p>
    <h3>Additional App Requirements</h3>
<ul><li> You may have received some points off for project 2. Please update relevant parts and fix any lingering issues.</li></ul>
<p>I’d like you to add two new items to your app (if you already had some of this you can just add to it to meet the specifications below).</p>
<ul><li>(At least) two supervised learning models (feel free to branch out to things we didn’t discuss if you’d
like).</li>
<ul><li>You should give the user some functionality for choosing model settings (variables used, number of trees, etc.) and for changing relevant output.</ul>
</li>
<li>(At least) one of our unsupervised learning methods should be added.</li>
<ul><li>Again, give the user functionality in terms of variables used, number of PCs, number of clusters, clustering method, etc. as well as for changing the way the results are displayed</li></ul>

<h3>Effect of Surface and Vision on Balance (copy from <a href='http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ctsib.html'>www.statsci.org</a>)</h3>
<p>Keywords: repeated measures, ordinal regression</p>
<hr><h3>Description</h3>
<p>The balance of subjects were observed for two different surfaces and for restricted and unrestricted vision. Balance was assessed qualitatively on an ordinal 4-point scale based on observation by the experimenter. Subjects were expected to be better balanced (show less sway) when standing on the normal surface than on foam, and when their eyes were open rather than closed or when their vision was restricted by a dome. </p>
<p>Equal numbers of male and female subjects were chosen.  For both males and females, ten older (more than 24 years old) and ten younger subjects were selected.</p>
<p>The data is available in two formats. The is in univariate or &quot;strung out form&quot; which is suitable for entry to Minitab or S-Plus and to most mixed model programs. The second is in repeated measures format which is suitable for SPSS and for most special purpose repeated measures programs.</p>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      
      <p>The data is best analysed using ordinal methods, but normal analysis of variance gives a good approximation. We see strong effects for Surface and Vision, and an interesting interaction between Sex and Vision. If ordinal regression is used, the two 4's in the response will need to be recoded to 3's.</p>
